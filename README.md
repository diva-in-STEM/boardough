### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
*   Python 3.8+
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Node.js & npm (or yarn)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    First, clone the `boardough` repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/boardough/boardough.git
    cd boardough
    ```

2.  **Set Up Python Environment**

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

    *Note: A `requirements.txt` file still needs to be generated for this project.*

3.  **Initialize the Database**

    `boardough` uses a SQLite database by default. Initialize it using the provided schema:

    ```bash
    python app.py initdb
    ```


4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**

    Navigate to the project root and install JavaScript dependencies, including `flowbite`:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you prefer yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

    This will install all packages listed in `package.json`, including `flowbite` for UI components.


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once installed, you can start `boardough` and access your dashboard maker.

1.  **Start the Application**

    From the project root, with your Python virtual environment activated, run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py run
    ```

    This will typically start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Access the Dashboard**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You should see the `boardough` interface where you can start building dashboards.
